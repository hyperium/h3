# 11.2.2.  Settings Parameters
#
# This document establishes a registry for HTTP/3 settings.  The
# "HTTP/3 Settings" registry governs a 62-bit space.  This registry
# follows the QUIC registry policy; see Section 11.2.  Permanent
# registrations in this registry are assigned using the Specification
# Required policy ([RFC8126]), except for values between 0x00 and 0x3f
# (in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using Standards
# Action or IESG Approval as defined in Sections 4.9 and 4.10 of
# [RFC8126].
# 
# While this registry is separate from the "HTTP/2 Settings" registry
# defined in [HTTP/2], it is preferable that the assignments parallel
# each other.  If an entry is present in only one registry, every
# effort SHOULD be made to avoid assigning the corresponding value to
# an unrelated operation.  Expert reviewers MAY reject unrelated
# registrations that would conflict with the same value in the
# corresponding registry.
# 
# In addition to common fields as described in Section 11.2, permanent
# registrations in this registry MUST include the following fields:
# 
# Setting Name:  A symbolic name for the setting.  Specifying a setting
#    name is optional.
# 
# Default:  The value of the setting unless otherwise indicated.  A
#    default SHOULD be the most restrictive possible value.
# 
# The entries in Table 3 are registered by this document.
