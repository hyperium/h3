quote = '''
HTTP/3 clients MUST support a mechanism to indicate the
target host to the server during the TLS handshake.
'''
reason = '''
This pertains to the TLS implementation, as h3 does not inspect TLS
messages.

quote = '''
If the server is
identified by a domain name ([DNS-TERMS]), clients MUST send the
Server Name Indication (SNI; [RFC6066]) TLS extension unless an
alternative mechanism to indicate the target host is used.

This pertains to the TLS implementation, as h3 does not inspect TLS
messages.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
During connection establishment, HTTP/3 support is indicated by
selecting the ALPN token "h3" in the TLS handshake.  Support for
other application-layer protocols MAY be offered in the same
handshake.

h3 does not handle protocol negotiation.
