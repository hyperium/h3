The server sends a client-
initiated bidirectional stream ID; the client sends a push ID.
Requests or pushes with the indicated identifier or greater are
rejected (Section 4.1.1) by the sender of the GOAWAY.  This
identifier MAY be zero if no requests or pushes were processed.

Clients
MAY establish a new connection to send additional requests.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Servers SHOULD send a GOAWAY frame when the closing of a connection
is known in advance, even if the advance notice is small, so that the
remote peer can know whether or not a request has been partially
processed.
'''
reason = '''
The user should initiate this, as h3 is unable to anticipate when to
close a connection.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Once all accepted requests and pushes have been processed, the
endpoint can permit the connection to become idle, or it MAY initiate
an immediate closure of the connection.
'''
reason = '''
The user should decide how to handle this, as h3 should not know
anything about message processing.
