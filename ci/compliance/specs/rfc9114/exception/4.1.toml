quote = '''
Because some messages are large or unbounded, endpoints
SHOULD begin processing partial HTTP messages once enough of the
message has been received to make progress.
'''
reason = '''
This should be initiated by the user, as h3 cannot determine when the
received message is enough.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
When the server does
not need to receive the remainder of the request, it MAY abort
reading the request stream, send a complete response, and cleanly
close the sending part of the stream.  The error code H3_NO_ERROR
SHOULD be used when requesting that the client stop sending on the
request stream.
'''
reason = '''
This should be initiated by the user, as h3 cannot determine if the
remainder of the request is needed.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Clients MUST NOT discard complete responses as a
result of having their request terminated abruptly, though clients
can always discard responses at their discretion for other reasons.
'''
reason = '''
h3 does not discard complete responses, but h3 has no control over
whether the user will do.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
If the server sends a partial or complete response but does not abort
reading the request, clients SHOULD continue sending the content of
the request and close the stream normally.
'''
reason = '''
h3 does not need to do anything specific.
