Because some messages are large or unbounded, endpoints
SHOULD begin processing partial HTTP messages once enough of the
message has been received to make progress.

This should be initiated by the user, as h3 cannot determine when the
received message is enough.

When the server does
not need to receive the remainder of the request, it MAY abort
reading the request stream, send a complete response, and cleanly
close the sending part of the stream.  The error code H3_NO_ERROR
SHOULD be used when requesting that the client stop sending on the
request stream.

This should be initiated by the user, as h3 cannot determine if the

Clients MUST NOT discard complete responses as a
result of having their request terminated abruptly, though clients
can always discard responses at their discretion for other reasons.

reason = '''
h3 does not discard complete responses, but h3 has no control over
whether the user will do.

If the server sends a partial or complete response but does not abort
reading the request, clients SHOULD continue sending the content of
the request and close the stream normally.

h3 does not need to do anything specific.

After sending a final
response, the server MUST close the stream for sending.

Users of h3 should close the stream for sending after sending a final response. As documented in the server docs.
