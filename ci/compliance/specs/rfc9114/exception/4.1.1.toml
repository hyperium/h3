quote = '''
Once a request stream has been opened, the request MAY be cancelled
by either endpoint.
'''
reason = '''
h3 does enable the user to cancel requests.  It is up to the user to
decide when to do it.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
When possible, it is RECOMMENDED that servers
send an HTTP response with an appropriate status code rather than
cancelling a request it has already begun processing.
'''
reason = '''
The user should handle this, as h3 should not know anything about
request processing.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
When the server cancels a request without performing any application
processing, the request is considered "rejected".  The server SHOULD
abort its response stream with the error code H3_REQUEST_REJECTED.
'''
reason = '''
The user should handle this, as h3 should not know anything about
request processing.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Servers MUST NOT use the H3_REQUEST_REJECTED error code for requests
that were partially or fully processed.
'''
reason = '''
The user should handle this, as h3 should not know anything about
request processing.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
When a server abandons a
response after partial processing, it SHOULD abort its response
stream with the error code H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.
'''
reason = '''
The user should initiate this, as h3 should not know anything about
request processing.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Client SHOULD use the error code H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED to cancel
requests.
'''
reason = '''
The user should initiate this, as h3 should not decide when to cancel
requests.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Upon receipt of this error code, a server MAY abruptly
terminate the response using the error code H3_REQUEST_REJECTED if no
processing was performed.
'''
reason = '''
The user should initiate this, as h3 should not know anything about
request processing.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
If a stream is cancelled after receiving a complete response, the
client MAY ignore the cancellation and use the response.
'''
reason = '''
It should be up to the user to decide.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
Only idempotent actions such as GET,
PUT, or DELETE can be safely retried; a client SHOULD NOT
automatically retry a request with a non-idempotent method unless it
has some means to know that the request semantics are idempotent
independent of the method or some means to detect that the original
request was never applied.
'''
reason = '''
This should be left to the user to decide.
