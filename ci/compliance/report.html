However,","   that has a negative impact on congestion control and network","   efficiency, since TCP does not share congestion control across","   multiple connections.","","   HTTP/2 ([HTTP/2]) introduced a binary framing and multiplexing layer","   to improve latency without modifying the transport layer.  However,","   because the parallel nature of HTTP/2's multiplexing is not visible","   to TCP's loss recovery mechanisms, a lost or reordered packet causes","   all active transactions to experience a stall regardless of whether","   that transaction was directly impacted by the lost packet."]},{"id":"section-1.2","title":"Delegation to QUIC","lines":["   The QUIC transport protocol incorporates stream multiplexing and per-","   stream flow control, similar to that provided by the HTTP/2 framing","   layer.  By providing reliability at the stream level and congestion","   control across the entire connection, QUIC has the capability to","   improve the performance of HTTP compared to a TCP mapping.  QUIC also","   incorporates TLS 1.3 ([TLS]) at the transport layer, offering","   comparable confidentiality and integrity to running TLS over TCP,","   with the improved connection setup latency of TCP Fast Open ([TFO]).","","   This document defines HTTP/3: a mapping of HTTP semantics over the","   QUIC transport protocol, drawing heavily on the design of HTTP/2.","   HTTP/3 relies on QUIC to provide confidentiality and integrity","   protection of data; peer authentication; and reliable, in-order, per-","   stream delivery.  While delegating stream lifetime and flow-control","   issues to QUIC, a binary framing similar to the HTTP/2 framing is","   used on each stream.  Some HTTP/2 features are subsumed by QUIC,","   while other features are implemented atop QUIC.","","   QUIC is described in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

QUIC provides protocol","   negotiation, stream-based multiplexing, and flow control.  Discovery","   of an HTTP/3 endpoint is described in Section 3.1.","","   Within each stream, the basic unit of HTTP/3 communication is a frame","   (Section 7.2).  Each frame type serves a different purpose.  For","   example, HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of HTTP requests and","   responses (Section 4.1).  Frames that apply to the entire connection","   are conveyed on a dedicated control stream.","","   Multiplexing of requests is performed using the QUIC stream","   abstraction, which is described in Section 2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].","   Each request-response pair consumes a single QUIC stream.  Streams","   are independent of each other, so one stream that is blocked or","   suffers packet loss does not prevent progress on other streams.","","   Server push is an interaction mode introduced in HTTP/2 ([HTTP/2])","   that permits a server to push a request-response exchange to a client","   in anticipation of the client making the indicated request.  This","   trades off network usage against a potential latency gain.  Several","   HTTP/3 frames are used to manage server push, such as PUSH_PROMISE,","   MAX_PUSH_ID, and CANCEL_PUSH.","","   As in HTTP/2, request and response fields are compressed for","   transmission.  Because HPACK ([HPACK]) relies on in-order","   transmission of compressed field sections (a guarantee not provided","   by QUIC), HTTP/3 replaces HPACK with QPACK ([QPACK]).  QPACK uses","   separate unidirectional streams to modify and track field table","   state, while encoded field sections refer to the state of the table","   without modifying it."]},{"id":"section-2.1","title":"Document Organization","lines":["   The following sections provide a detailed overview of the lifecycle","   of an HTTP/3 connection:","","   *  \"Connection Setup and Management\" (Section 3) covers how an HTTP/3","      endpoint is discovered and an HTTP/3 connection is established.","","   *  \"Expressing HTTP Semantics in HTTP/3\" (Section 4) describes how","      HTTP semantics are expressed using frames.","","   *  \"Connection Closure\" (Section 5) describes how HTTP/3 connections","      are terminated, either gracefully or abruptly.","","   The details of the wire protocol and interactions with the transport","   are described in subsequent sections:","","   *  \"Stream Mapping and Usage\" (Section 6) describes the way QUIC","      streams are used.","","   *  \"HTTP Framing Layer\" (Section 7) describes the frames used on most","      streams.","","   *  \"Error Handling\" (Section 8) describes how error conditions are","      handled and expressed, either on a particular stream or for the","      connection as a whole.","","   Additional resources are provided in the final sections:","","   *  \"Extensions to HTTP/3\" (Section 9) describes how new capabilities","      can be added in future documents.","","   *  A more detailed comparison between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 can be found","      in Appendix A."]},{"id":"section-2.2","title":"Conventions and Terminology","lines":["   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",","   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and","   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in","   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all","   capitals, as shown here.","","   This document uses the variable-length integer encoding from","   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].","","   The following terms are used:","","   abort:  An abrupt termination of a connection or stream, possibly due","      to an error condition.","","   client:  The endpoint that initiates an HTTP/3 connection.

QUIC considers a stream closed when all data has been received","   and sent data has been acknowledged by the peer.  HTTP/2 considers a","   stream closed when the frame containing the END_STREAM bit has been","   committed to the transport.  As a result, the stream for an","   equivalent exchange could remain \"active\" for a longer period of","   time.  HTTP/3 servers might choose to permit a larger number of","   concurrent client-initiated bidirectional streams to achieve","   equivalent concurrency to HTTP/2, depending on the expected usage","   patterns.","","   In HTTP/2, only request and response bodies (the frame payload of","   DATA frames) are subject to flow control.  All HTTP/3 frames are sent","   on QUIC streams, so all frames on all streams are flow controlled in","   HTTP/3.","","   Due to the presence of other unidirectional stream types, HTTP/3 does","   not rely exclusively on the number of concurrent unidirectional","   streams to control the number of concurrent in-flight pushes.","   Instead, HTTP/3 clients use the MAX_PUSH_ID frame to control the","   number of pushes received from an HTTP/3 server."]},{"id":"appendix-A.2","title":"HTTP Frame Types","lines":["   Many framing concepts from HTTP/2 can be elided on QUIC, because the","   transport deals with them.
