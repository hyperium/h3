Each frame type serves a different purpose.  For","example, HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of HTTP requests and","responses (Section 4.1).  Frames that apply to the entire connection","are conveyed on a dedicated control stream.","","Multiplexing of requests is performed using the QUIC stream","abstraction, which is described in Section 2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].","Each request-response pair consumes a single QUIC stream.  Streams","are independent of each other, so one stream that is blocked or","suffers packet loss does not prevent progress on other streams.","","Server push is an interaction mode introduced in HTTP/2 ([HTTP/2])","that permits a server to push a request-response exchange to a client","in anticipation of the client making the indicated request.  This","trades off network usage against a potential latency gain.  Several","HTTP/3 frames are used to manage server push, such as PUSH_PROMISE,","MAX_PUSH_ID, and CANCEL_PUSH.","","As in HTTP/2, request and response fields are compressed for","transmission.  Because HPACK ([HPACK]) relies on in-order","transmission of compressed field sections (a guarantee not provided","by QUIC), HTTP/3 replaces HPACK with QPACK ([QPACK]).

QUIC considers a stream closed when all data has been received","and sent data has been acknowledged by the peer.  HTTP/2 considers a","stream closed when the frame containing the END_STREAM bit has been","committed to the transport.  As a result, the stream for an","equivalent exchange could remain \"active\" for a longer period of","time.  HTTP/3 servers might choose to permit a larger number of","concurrent client-initiated bidirectional streams to achieve","equivalent concurrency to HTTP/2, depending on the expected usage","patterns.","","In HTTP/2, only request and response bodies (the frame payload of","DATA frames) are subject to flow control.  All HTTP/3 frames are sent","on QUIC streams, so all frames on all streams are flow controlled in","HTTP/3.","","Due to the presence of other unidirectional stream types, HTTP/3 does","not rely exclusively on the number of concurrent unidirectional","streams to control the number of concurrent in-flight pushes.","Instead, HTTP/3 clients use the MAX_PUSH_ID frame to control the","number of pushes received from an HTTP/3 server."]},{"id":"appendix-A.2","title":"HTTP Frame Types","lines":["Many framing concepts from HTTP/2 can be elided on QUIC, because the","transport deals with them.
