Once a connection to a server endpoint exists, this connection MAY be
reused for requests with multiple different URI authority components.
'''
reason = '''
h3 does not have to do anything specific, as we cannot anticipate when
will the client decide to reuse a connection.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
To use an existing connection for a new origin, clients MUST validate
the certificate presented by the server for the new origin server
using the process described in Section 4.3.4 of [HTTP].
'''
reason = '''
This should be handled by the user, as h3 does not inspect certificate
messages.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
If the certificate is not acceptable with regard to the new origin
for any reason, the connection MUST NOT be reused and a new
connection SHOULD be established for the new origin.
'''
reason = '''
This should be handled by the user, as h3 does not inspect certificate
messages.
'''

[[exception]]
quote = '''
If the reason
the certificate cannot be verified might apply to other origins
already associated with the connection, the client SHOULD revalidate
the server certificate for those origins.
'''
reason = '''
This should be handled by the user, as h3 does not inspect certificate
messages.

[[exception]]
quote = '''
A client MAY open
multiple HTTP/3 connections to the same IP address and UDP port using
different transport or TLS configurations but SHOULD avoid creating
multiple connections with the same configuration.

reason = '''
This pertains to the user of h3.
